all the Card- classess are cards that are all extended from the Card.java class that has the comments for how card mechanics work

The Game class contains all logic for the turn-based combat and card recycling mechanics

The LevelSelect class contains logic for navigating between panels and opening games

The Welcome screen is how you enter the game.

There is a savefile.txt file that is created when the game is started this saves your character and stats and cards.
